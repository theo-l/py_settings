# py_settings
A simple explicit module level settings with env and file configuration

## Description
Normally, we need a way to start our project with some pre-configured options&value. Nowadays, we have a 
lot of open source libs also, like dotenv, Django, dynaconf, etc. But with the experience during the last
year, and also some personal preferences, I would like to follow the ZEN of python *explicit is better than
implicit*.

So I created this project to make the project settings with an explicit way and based on python module level. 
With the explicit rule, we need to declare everything we need
